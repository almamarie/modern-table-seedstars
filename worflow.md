## 📝 Suggested Roadmap

- [x] **Scaffold project** → React + Tailwind.
- [x] **Implement table with mock data** (say, participants or loan applications).

- [x] **Add column reordering** (drag & drop).
- [ ] **Add bulk row selection + action menu.**

- [ ] **Add “save view” feature** (localStorage is enough).
- [ ] **Test with a large dataset** (e.g., 10k mock rows) to check performance.

- [ ] **Polish UI** (filters, sorting, search – optional but nice).
- [ ] **Write README** explaining design & trade-offs.

- [ ] **Record demo video** showing the above features.
